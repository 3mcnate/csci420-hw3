l = unit vector to light source
n = surface normal
v = unit vector to viewer
r = reflection of l at p, r = 2 (l dot n)n - l

triangle 2 not appearing in siggraph


Bugs:
- parts of the floor are still not being rendered
- image output doesn't work correctly (I feel like this is not even my fault)

FIXED
- colors are off (too bright) -> DONE
  ** explanation: the final interpolated values for Ks and Kd were normalized, when they shouldn't have been
  ** fix: remove normalization of ks and Kd
  
- shininess not working -> DONE
  ** explanation: incorrect Phong Illumination equation (had ks.x * pow(ks.x * RdotV, sh), should be ks.x * pow(RdotV, sh))
  ** fix: fixed equation 

- Some pixels aren't being shaded for some reason -> DONE
  ** explanation: shadow rays intersecting with their own origin triangle/sphere 
  ** fix: make the intersection point slightly off the surface 

- some color not working at all (snow and table scenes) -> DONE
  ks is NaN for some reason?
  ** explanation: ks was NaN because normalize() didn't check if magnitude was 0 when dividing
  ** fix: add divide by zero check to normalize()
